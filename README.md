# CF_OPS201_CHALLENGES

## About

This repository consists of a handful of commonly used Bash and Power Shell scripts. These use cases were used to learn how to successfully navigate, interact and control the computer processes. I am learning these skills to better understand the fundamentals of how a computer operates. Bash and PowerShell are the underlying command processors within Linux and Windows operating systems.

## What aspects of Bash and PowerShell

The fundamental concepts that I have learned with using Bash are creating Bash scripts, variables, functions, arrays, concatenate strings, loops, and conditional statements. Commands in Windows includes Grep, Windows Batch scripting, automation, and several Windows specific commands/ Windows Cmdlets.

## Favorite Challenge

My favorite ops challenge assignment was Class10-PowerShell_Tools. In this challenge, I used PowerShell to analyze, initialize, and terminate program processes. This was very interesting to me. Knowing such commands will be very beneficial to identify the power of PowerShell and the possibility to identify cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities in operating systems.

## How shell scripting applies to the workplace

Shell scripting can be very useful in all workplaces. The ability to automate a process can increase productivity and efficiency. One possible example of this is when a company is setting up their companyâ€™s workstation computers. They can have a team of workers do the process manually and a script written to do the same process can take much less time and money. In addition, the written script can be updated if the company decides to use a new software or technology.

## Future project to continue

If I had the time to continue to improve a script it would be Class13-Bash_Domain_Analyzer. There is a lot of potential for this script to be very helpful as it provides domain information such as IP address and Domain specific information. This information could be beneficial to a security analyst to check any vulnerabilities or a hacker looking for their next victim.

## Where to improve next on Shell Scripting

The aspect of shell scripting that I hope to improve next is adding more complexity and automation. It could include using a Raspberry Pi device or making scripting tools to gain information about a target system for Capture the Flag (CTF) or another purpose.
